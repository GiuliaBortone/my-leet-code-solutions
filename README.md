### Hello everyone!

I created this repository to solve LeetCode problems. I wanted to approach them in a different way than how you'd do
on LeetCode itself, where you have the tests already done and you simply write the code to make it run.

I'm going to solve them with a [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html) approach, starting from
the simplest input and then using the ones LeetCode provides. This will allow me to not rush the answer and hopefully
get an efficient solution. For each problem, I am also going to add a description of what I have done, so that you can
understand the thought behind it.

I decided to do this in Kotlin, however I might sometime try with another language just for fun.
